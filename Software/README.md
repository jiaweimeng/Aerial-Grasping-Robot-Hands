## Introduction
In order to control the robot hand, we use one OpenCM9.04-C board and two Dynamixel motors (XM430-350-T). 
## OpenCM9.04
OpenCM9.04 is a microcontroller board based on 32bit ARM Cortex-M3. The OpenCM9.04’s schematics and source codes are open-source. Please click [here](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencm904/) for more information about OpenCM9.04.

The connections between OpenCM9.04-C board and other devices are shown in Fig. 4:

## Dynamixel motors
The DYNAMIXEL is a smart actuator system developed to be the exclusive connecting joints on a robot or mechanical structure. DYNAMIXELS’ are designed to be modular and daisy chained on any robot or mechanical design for powerful and flexible robotic movements. The DYNAMIXEL is a high performance actuator with a fully integrated DC (Direct Current) Motor + Reduction Gearhead + Controller + Driver + Network, all in one servo module actuator. Programmable and networkable, actuator status can be read and monitored through a data packet stream. Durability and quality is proven by world-class robot teams from over 30 countries.

## IDE
As OpenCM IDE will not be updated anymore, we recommend users to code on Arduino IDE for OpenCM9.04-C board. Here is the instruction for installing OpenCM9.04 package on Arduino IDE:
