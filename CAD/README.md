## Robot Hands CAD files
In this folder we provide appropriate 3D models (Solidworks .SLDPRT) and files for 3d printer (.stl) in order to replicate the proposed designs. 

The prototype (Fig. 2) of this aerial grasping robot hand is designed by [New Dexterity Research Team](https://www.newdexterity.org/) from the University of Auckland.

This aerial grasping robot hand has an improved mechanical structure design and a shell to protect the quick release mechanism compared with the prototype.
